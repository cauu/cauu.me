Hello, everybody.

It's such a long time not to update this blog. Approximately half a year. Time flies quickly, isn't it?

However, as I wrote in the title, it's a new journey just get started since I decided to keep writing something. But, first step 1 will be updating this "out-of-date" blog as I already left it for nearly 6 months.

So, firstly I'm going to do is to update the hexo framework.

<!--more-->

Here is the procedure which I found:

 1. Change into blog directory with package.json file

    run `npm install hexo`

 2. Check the version of Hexo

    run `hexo version`

Secondly, my current hexo theme is Next. So I looked into their github repo, which is []()https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next

You can easily use `git pull` to pull out new updates from theme github repo. Easy enough!

That's it. Hope it will help you figure out when you leave your hexo blog for a long while (like me) and wanna to keep updated with latest codes before you get started your new journey.

See you guys in next article! Hope you all have a good weekend.
